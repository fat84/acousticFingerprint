### Acoustic fingerprinting

Develop a methodology for creating unique fingerprints of songs and recognition similar to Shazam. The first time I saw Shazam in action it seemed like magic, and years later I've decided to give it a try and develop my own version.

It turned out, once I understood Discrete Fourier Transformation and figured out how to apply it to create unique song fingerprints, the rest is pretty straightforward.

The work was inspired after reading an article that describes some of the components in Shazam's algorithm. If you are interested you can find the article here:  http://coding-geek.com/how-shazam-works/
